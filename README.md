# ChainOptim

ChainOptim is a Supply Chain Manager/Optimizer in early stages of development, built with Angular.js, Spring Boot and MySQL. This repository contains the backend source code, see the frontend [here](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ChainOptim-frontend).

ChainOptim is designed to be a flexible, general service that is suitable to clients from a variety of sectors. It employs a Multi-Tenant architecture that minimizes costs and ensures better performance and communication as the network of associated clients grows larger. The service requires more upfront configuration but in return aims to deliver more sensible and tailored analyses, from supplier performance to distribution effectiveness.

## Quickstart
1. Fork and fetch the frontend and backend repositories.
2. For the frontend, run `ng serve`.
3. For the backend, compile and run the Spring Boot application.
4. For the database, import the schema from `database\schema` into your local MySQL server.
