At ChainOptim we believe in the value of the open-source, community-driven approach to developing a healthy software ecosystem. As such, contributions of any kind are highly encouraged and greatly appreciated. Whether you've found a bug, have a feature in mind, or see a need for documentation improvements, your input is valuable. We will soon add a roadmap covering the most pressing issues to work on, as well as our long-term goals.

## Github Workflow
1. Fork and fetch the ChainOptim repository you want to work on.
2. Create a branch for your work with a suggestive name, eg `feature-add-x`.
3. Make your changes in your branch, keeping commits small and focused. Aim for clear commit messages that explain the "why" behind your changes.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository once you're ready to share your contributions. Describe the changes you've made and any additional context that might help the review process.

## Get started developing
Follow the steps underline in the [README.md](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ChainOptim-backend/blob/main/README.md).

## Style guides
We aim to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. Detailed style guides will be added soon. In the meantime, please adhere to the following general principles:

- Follow existing code conventions in the project.
- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.

## Code of Conduct

Please read [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TudorOrban/ChainOptim-backend/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand what behaviors will not be tolerated.
